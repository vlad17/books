# Don't Bargain over Positions

An anti-pattern for negotiation is bargaining over positions.

Both sides take a visible marker for what they want, have opposing bid/asks, and do many rounds of concessions until a final price is reached (or not).

## An Example

    Customer: How much do you want for this brass dish?
    Shopkeeper: It's beautiful, $75.
    Customer: Oh, c'mon, it's dented. $15.
    Shopkeeper: $15 is't serious, $60.
    etc.

Taking positions is somewhat useful, in that it provides an anchor in an uncertain situation to value.

## Negotiation Criteria

But it fails to meet other criteria for a negotiation procedure:

 * wise agreement (I suppose this mean will be upheld long term, or some maximin outcome is attained)
 * efficient (can be quickly reached)
 * amicable
 
### Position Bargaining is Unwise

Positions place you in a psychologically couched position: the more it's clarified in defense of a particular number, the more it's committed to your identity. 

Ego identification creates a personal reason to hold the line.

Worry of "you went back on your word from a minute ago, why is your current line meaningful" prevents people from coalescing.

Negative example: Soviet Union and US bargaining over inspection counts of nuclear facilities (3 vs 10) when real concern was the depth of inspections.

Positive example: Iraqi farmers mandated to vacate their land for oil per contract ready to start a fight but could actually coexist while surveying is going on to finish their crop.

Positions distract attention from underlying concerns.

### Position Bargaining is Inefficient

Standard back-and-forth requires individual decisions, each of which requires concession to counterparty, a new decision about what to ask. Both psychologically and technically exhausting.

### Position Bargaining is not Amicable

Positions couch the opposing party as diametrically opposed to the interests of the first.

## Soft vs Hard Spectrum

_VF Note_: this was discussed in the introduction already. But the customer/shopkeeper example is already a questionable one, aren't the underlying interests already diametrically opposed? How does one go about resolving those.

## An Alternative

Negotiation includes both the substantive question, which is the first-order set of items and conditioned being negotiated over, and a **meta-game**, where every negotiation move also maps into a secon-order discussion which shapes the rules of the negotiation going forward.

Alternative to hard/soft spectrum is to change the single, concrete position-based argument that negotiation usually sets out being framed in. _VF Note_: cynically, this just sounds like a big diversion tactic, bringing in multi-faceted "latent interests". Usually, people do distill their interests to a position, so convincing them to do otherwise seems possible but also goes against a microeconomics 101 view of the situation, which really is zero-sum.

The four points of principled negotiation.

1. **People**: Separate the people from the problem
1. **Interests**: Focus on interests, not positions
1. **Options**: Invent multiple options for mutual gains before deciding what to do.
1. **Criteria**: Insist that the result be based on some objective standard.

_VF Note:_ may be getting ahead of myself on the book here, but it seems like in practice an edge case is that the above framework in cases of simple single-position-representing-transparent-diametrically-opposed-interests becomes just a compromise under an "objective standard" which just begs the question, why won't we get an equivalent negotiation over the standard objective measure here?

Phases of negotiation.

1. **Analysis**: diagnose the situation, gather information, tabulate perceptions, emotions, unclear communication. Note any options or criteria on the table already.
1. **Planning**: Generate ideas for handling people problems, prioritizing personal interests. Put yourself in counterparty's shoes, what are their emotions, interests, priorities? What are realistic outcomes a negotiation? Any options?
1. **Discussion**: Expressing how to look towards agreement. Allow expression of feelings of frustration and anger (and be transparent but respectful). Acknowledge difficulties emotially and in communication for those to be addressed. Make sure all intersts are understood. Make sure mutual advantage is clear. Seek agreement on objective standards for resolving opposing interests.

We will see throughout the book how this will ensure wise, efficient, and amicable agreements.
