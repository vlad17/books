# Motivation
* This is important, as it leads to higher performance.
  * You can’t ever satisfy hunger, so find a way to create it.
  * There's no such thing as a motivation tablet.
You have to create some facade that they believe in so that they will follow it

### The pyramid of motivation, the lower one overrides
![Pyramid of Motivation](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS6JSQAJ7gcGGKg4QHRbaBGagL_WjKJ_arZYMBvSwK9297lxib8Yg)
Lower in the Pyramid is more intrisic. Without the base, you cannot build higher.
* __Physiological__
  * will I die tomorrow? This is a base state.
* __Safety/Security__
  * will my state of living maintain or improve?
* __Social/Affiliation__
  * Do I have pride in my org, do I have friends at work? Friends is actually surprisingly important, some people go back to work because they appreciate the social interaction there.
  * silicon valley tech overemphasizes alignment with company goals. Not for motivation maybe, resolving Complexity Ambiguity, business goals.
* __Esteem/Recognition__
  * Am i cool? external coolness, are you valuable to who you care about. Basically, does your title/other's opinions reflect what you want? Are you senior software eng vs junior, are you director vs manager.
* __Self-Actualization__
  * Can I create my own dopamine?
  * Self-Actualization is best, because there is no finish line. All others are comparators to other’s metrics, self-actualization is comparison to your own metric. You have to beat yourself, by winning, you have a harder challenge to face.
  * Another example of self-actualization is the competitive metric. However, this can fall off, so it's better to have a personal competitive. Be better than your yesterday.
### The only important metric is output
* Performance metrics are valuable for self-actualize
   * Some examples include: comments, diffs, time in review, time to land, tasks created, tasks closed, SLOC. These are arbitrary things that can be maximized.
### Workaholic Prejudice
* How do you beat it?
  * Make it a mantra. People are willing to try hard in if they believe in it. So cults can encourage motivation in some sense.
  * Sports require religious, overbearing dedication, why not work.
  * Downside is that you don't have to be the best to do work, and most people do not ascribe to workaholic.
### Task Relevant Maturity (TRM)
* Is just how good a person is at a particular task
* It's measured on specific employee compared to task.
* An example is just because you are good at coding on backend, doesn't mean you are good at frontend. There's depth to each level.
* Levels of TRM
  * Low - need to give full direction, structured.
  * Med - 2-way communication, make sure things are working.
  * High - No communication needed, only monitoring to stay updated.
### Performance Review
* tell employee how to optimize.
* output measures and internal metrics what you look at.
* Output is external, like sales, things shipped.
* Internal is like code written, comments made, tasks followed up on.
  * Need to weight internal things differently than external. Better Engineering is important, as is shipping code.
* As a manager, your performance rating can’t be higher than your org.
### Assessment
Level, listen, leave yourself out
pro’s, cons, and takeaways
you need to project your thoughts into their head. They don’t need to agree with you, then need to agree to do what you say
You have to get poor performer to own up to their performance
They Ignore, Deny, Blame others, Assume Responsibility, Find Solution
Commitment to action is acceptable. As before, don’t need to agree
Give review hardcopy in advance, then you both win when you discuss it
Interviewing - there are tons of guides on this. It seems hard to evaluate, because all you have is a piece of paper and their words. Try to find reliable actor to vouch for them.
they just list random interview techniques. there are tons of these online. If you want to interview someone, take time preparing, be direct, and get the answers you want.
When some1 wants to quit, you have to give them what they want
then you have to say that they deserve it
Only if you value them. If you dont, then should still pretend, but let them go. oh no woopsiess.
Money should compromise between performance and experience.
Leveling up gives you more fat cash.
Meets/exceeds
promote at exceeds, maintain at meets. Some people stay at meets. These r nice people. Some people want exceeds. The goal is to get them to the level where they are meets forever, without having them start to underperform
Peter principle
recycle losers respectfully. This seems hard to do and is mentioned offhand.
you need to train constantly and offer courses to improve others. Training courses are hard to make and should be vetted and practiced on experienced members first to fix flaws.
