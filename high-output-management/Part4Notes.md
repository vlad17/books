### Motivation
* This is important, as it leads to higher performance.
  * You can’t ever satisfy hunger, so find a way to create it.
  * There's no such thing as a motivation tablet.
You have to create some facade that they believe in so that they will follow it

Esteem/Recognition - Am i cool? external coolness, are you valuable to who you care about.
Self-Actualization - Can I create my own dopamine?
Self-Actualization is best, because there is no finish line. All others are comparators to other’s metrics, self-actualization is comparison to your own metric. You have to beat yourself, by winning, you have a harder challenge to face.
competitive metric can fall off, personal competitive
Important metric is output
Performance metrics are valuable for self-actualize
comments, diffs, time in review, time to land, tasks created, tasks closed, SLOC. These are arbitrary things that can be maximized
workaholic prejudice. How do you beat it? Make it a mantra

Performance review is important
tell them how to optimize.
output measures and internal. Output is external, like sales, things shipped. Internal is like code written, comments made, tasks followed up on.
Need to weight internal things differently than external. Better Engineering is important, as is shipping code.
As a manager, your performance rating can’t be higher than ur org if u r in charge.
Assessment
Level, listen, leave yourself out
pro’s, cons, and takeaways
you need to project your thoughts into their head. They don’t need to agree with you, then need to agree to do what you say
You have to get poor performer to own up to their performance
They Ignore, Deny, Blame others, Assume Responsibility, Find Solution
Commitment to action is acceptable. As before, don’t need to agree
Give review hardcopy in advance, then you both win when you discuss it
Interviewing - there are tons of guides on this. It seems hard to evaluate, because all you have is a piece of paper and their words. Try to find reliable actor to vouch for them.
they just list random interview techniques. there are tons of these online. If you want to interview someone, take time preparing, be direct, and get the answers you want.
When some1 wants to quit, you have to give them what they want

Only if you value them. If you dont, then should still pretend, but let them go. oh no woopsiess.
Money should compromise between performance and experience.
Leveling up gives you more fat cash.
Meets/exceeds
promote at exceeds, maintain at meets. Some people stay at meets. These r nice people. Some people want exceeds. The goal is to get them to the level where they are meets forever, without having them start to underperform
Peter principle
recycle losers respectfully. This seems hard to do and is mentioned offhand.
you need to train constantly and offer courses to improve others. Training courses are hard to make and should be vetted and practiced on experienced members first to fix flaws.
