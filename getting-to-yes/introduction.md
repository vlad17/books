# Introduction

Negotiation is a fact of life, whether you recognize it or not.

Some examples:

* Discussing a raise with your boss.
* Agreeing with a stranger on the price of their house.
* Lawyers trying to settle a lawsuit arising from a car accident.
* A group of oil companies planning a joint venture for offshore oil.
* A city official meeting with union leaders to prevent a transit strike.
* The US Secretary of state discussing limiting nuclear arms with Russia.

## What is Negotiation?

**Negotiation** is the back-and-forth communication designed to reach an agreement when you and the other side have some interests that are shared and others that are opposed or simply different.

What is the difference between negotiation and debate?
Debate is similar to positional, rather than shared negotiation. Debate probably won’t convince your opponent, they will not want to concede. However, debate has a lot of value for third-party if they want to understand the issue more fully. Politicians on TV are doing debate, because they have little vested interest in the conclusion of the debate. Committees that decide the context of the bill are behind closed doors, and do more negotiation to determine contents of bill (because here politicians have vested interests to get re-elected, so they have to make sure they get their lobbyist’s requests).

## The Naive View of Negotiation

**Soft Negotiation** avoids personal conflict, makes concessions to readily reach agreement in hopes of preserving the relationship. Note, however, that frequently this results in agreements which leave the soft negotiation party bitter and resentful, which don't help.

**Hard Negotiation** does not compromise, give concessions, and views negotiation as zero-sum. Frequently results in negotiation failure and loss of the relationship, even if successful at exploiting soft negotiators.

One might incorrectly assume that all negotiation strategies fall on a spectrum between the two above.

## A Third Way: Principled Negotiation

**Principled Negotiation** is "hard on merits" but "soft on people". It provides a mechanism to circumvent reasoning about the above spectrum between relationship-preservation and concession-avoidance in a zero-sum manner with a structured mechanism for identifying what each party is entitled to.

Rest of the book gives an overview of the method, along with considerations for negotiating with a powerful other, unengaged other, and discussion of tricks to defend against.

_VF Note:_ basis of the book seems to be cheery because in given examples there are positive sum creative strategies. Surely there are some negotiations where core interests disagree? Maybe the point is that by making core interests explicit, we get positive sum when it exists and a third-party yardstick when it doesn't. The latter seems like the interesting case to watch out for later in the book.
