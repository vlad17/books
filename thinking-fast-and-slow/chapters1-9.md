# Introduction

We often make decisions on a very intuitive level: understanding how our heuristics and biases work will let us make better decisions.

# The Characters of the Story

System 1
* Intuitive response
* Fast thinking, automatic
* Effortless
* Not voluntary

System 2
* Conscious
* Allocates attention
* Complex computatoins, logical thinking
* Single-threaded
* Slow

Division of labor: we try to System 1 all the time and fall back to System 2 when we recognize a hard problem.

*Cognitive illusion*: a mistake from System 1 that requires System 2 intervention.

System 1 and System 2 need not be mutually exclusive processes in the biological system of the brain, but they're useful metaphors.

# Attention and Effort

System 2 requires expenditure of finite mental effort:
* Try Add-1 task. People try and then break down after some time.
* Harder tasks break you down sooner.

Pupil correlates with focus.

System 2 can program System 1 for minor tasks: this is how we get gut-based expert intuition (e.g., juggling).

# The Lazy Controller

Israeli judges who haven't eaten consistently give out harsh punishments -- System 2 requires energy and focus and without it, people default to System 1 decisions.

People also default to System 1 whenever possible. Ex, the ball-and-bat:

> A bat and ball cost $1.10.
> The bat costs one dollar more than the ball.
> How much does the ball cost?

People default to the "easier" substituted problem of $1.10 - $1 but this gives the wrong answer.

## Intelligence != Rationality

Intelligence makes it easier for you to invoke system 2 but is not the primary driver, which is "rationality" or "engagement". 

Somehow this proven via the Cognitive Reflection Test which gives a System-1-appealing answer to brain teasers.

More details in _Rationality and the Reflective Mind_ by Keith Stanovich.

# The Associative Machine

System 1 attaches emotional reactions to reading words or other stimuli. Ideas are vertices in graphs with undirected and directed edges.

This implies _priming_. By bringing up connected vertices, or even once-removed connected vertices, we can affect behavior to be biased in ways related to the adjacent vertices.

* If you see EAT then you'll likely complete SO_P as SOUP rather than SOAP, though those might be replacements that are filled in with equal frequency otherwise.
* Honor system tip jar observed consistently higher payment for coffee when a picture of eyes is hung above the jar rather than flowers.

# Cognitive Ease

We take short cuts when we can, and it shows in our decision making and belief.

Becoming Famous Overnight
* The mere history of seeing certain names, even if they're unattached to anything, breeds false familiarity.
* People who have previously seen nonsensical names were likely to not call them out as fake celebrities later.

Other ways of making things easier to digest for truthiness:
* Bolder, clearer letters.
* Rhyming words.
* Simple tickers on your exchange breed confidence.

# Norms, Surprises, and Causes

Humans see causes and intentions, not statistical observations: infants show surprise consistently when squares moving on a screen don't match up with causal intuition (a pushing another square).

# A Machine For Jumping to Conclusions

We resolve ambiguity through context.

Halo effect: nearby observations influence interpretation of other nearby ones because of this reliance on context. For instance, when he randomized the order in which he graded papers one-by-one, he noticed much larger variablility in inter-question scores..

What you see is all there is -- if you only see one side of the argument you'll think it's right instead of wondering about what's missing.

# How Judgements Happen

Judgements are scalable but not summable:

* We can move between relative intensities easily (i.e., if he was as smart as he is tall).
* But we can't evaluate numerical estimates

E.g., Exxon Valdez oil spill, even though everyone was told that there were varying numbers of birds (2000 vs 20000 vs 200000) that could be saved, people still gave around $80 for the cause no matter what.

Emotional impact is how you'd evaluate above.

# Answer an Easier Question

Substitution is an approach to reduce System 2 work. Can we answer complex questions with immediate ballparks. May lead to errors.

E.g., How happy are you with your life these days -> What is my mood right now?
