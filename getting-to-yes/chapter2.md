# Separate the People from the Problem

## Negotiators are People

Human beings are emotional, so failing to deal sensitively with those needs can kill a negotiation, even if it's worse for both parties.

## Two Kinds of Interests

Interests come in two flavors: **substance** and **relationship**.

E.g., an antique dealer wants to both make a profit on a sale and turn a customer into a regular one.

Substance is the basis of the negotiation in the first place, but relationship for long-term interactions frequently matters too because of repeated engagments that would be coming in the future. At a minimum, relationship needs to be preserved for implementation of the agreement reached.

Positional bargaining puts relationship and substance in conflict because it frames negotiation as a contest of will --- who's more willing to burn the relationship for substance?

_VF Note:_ what if _you_, as the negotiator, are willing to sacrifice relationship for substance? You might not be interested in repeated engagements, and only want to preserve some bare minimum level of agreeableness. This means that in principle you can take a harder line negotiating. With principled negotiation, it looks like you give up this opportunity (which is fine if there are strong positive-sum solutions, but in "simplified" cases where positions boil down to singular conflicting interests, not so much).

## Disentanglement

Deal with people problems by changing how you treat people. Don't try to solve them with substantive concessions. (This will not address the former and be quite costly in substance.)

## Perception

Differences are defined by differences between the thinking and world view of the negotiators. To bridge, it's essential to have a model of the other's view.

### Empathy

Viewing from the other person's side might reveal new information or understanding. E.g., a tenant might only focus on how they pay the rent when asked every time, but the landlord views this as needing to ask every single month.

This may even change one's standing on some issues, which is a *benefit* of empathy. Finding interests where you can give way to the other reduces the area of conflict. _VF Note:_ Again, maybe this is aggressively zero-sum thinking, but this is something that can be used later during negotiation as a bargaining chip, is it really a smart negotiating move to give it away for free, especially when there will be an interest you care about later? Possibly, actually, as a signal of good will, if you make a big deal out of it.

### Avoid Fear-based Deductions

Cost of maximally negative interpretation is that it's an emotional block on *you* preventing notice of subtle changes of position or opportunities for lateral solutions.

### Avoid Blame

Blame puts people in a defensive position, entangling the people with the problem. Instead, distinguish the symptoms from the person being talked with.

Factory owner talking to service mechanic for generator that has broken several times after mechanic serviced it:
 * Our generator that you serviced broke down again. We need that generator to do our business, it's very frustrating to have it break over and over. <- Recognize own emotions, clarify interest
 * Tell us what you think, should we get a different mechanic? Is the problem with the generator?
 
_VF Note:_ Does the above seriously work? Asking mechanic A if they can recommend the competition?

### Discuss perceptions

Great way to reveal perceptions.

Do not dismiss interests that you're OK giving up as unimportant.  Per the note above, put more cynically, milk it for everything it's got. This communicates that you're willing to do something they'd like.

E.g., U.S. in ocean preservation discussions could've devoted substantial time towards working out the details of the technology exchange for underwater mining, which they ere okay with doing for developing nations. However, they didn't spend much time on this, and as a result had less interest from the developing natinos in participating in ecological preservation discussion.

### Build Better Perceptions for Them / Act Inconsistently with Negative Perceptions

Change people's mindset that you're a partner.

E.g. President Sadat of Egypt visited Jerusalem in 1977 four years after the Yom Kippur War, recognizing a capital which many Arabs at the time did not. This opened the door for negotiations at all.

### Give them a Stake

When people don't own the process, they're suspicious of the product.

Letting people own a stake in the process for coming up with the solution ties their ego to it.

E.g., during South African apartheid, white moderates tried to abolish discriminatory pass laws. However, this was done in an all-white parliamentary committee to discuss proposals. This was not taken up by the Blacks because they saw this as continued institution of white man's burden.

## Face-saving

Face saving carries derogatory connotation. However, it's important to let people portray themselves as consistent with earlier positions because they have an image to maintain to their constituents (which belies a latent interest to maintain status among a cohort they represent).

## Emotion

### Recognize and Understand Theirs and Yours

1. Explicitly identify your own emotions at the outset and during the negotiation.
1. Use this recognition to ask yourself "why are you feeling this way?"
1. Extract interests, both substantive, psychological, and relationship-oriented, as a result.

Apply the same reasoning for the other side. This may require guesswork or explicit asking and listening of the other side's emotional state.

### Core Concerns

Core drivers of emotions:

* **autonomy**: desire to make your own choices
* **appreciation**: desire to be recognized and valued
* **affiliation**: desire to belong
* **role**: desire to have purpose
* **status**: desire to feel fairly seen and acknowledged

### Role of Idenitty

Threat to identity is an emotional trigger. E.g., you may want to go to your manager for a raise. If part of this includes some kind of accusatory information, e.g., pointing out failing s and inconsistencies, your manager's sense of self (that they're a good manager, for instance), might be threatened, causing them to think about the implication as "you're not competent."

Regardless of the accuracy of the situation, this may shut your manager down and prevent you from getting a raise.

### Make Emotions Explicit

### Let them let off steam

Cheap way to get information an emotional release, letting people move on to more merit-based discussion.

### Leverage Symbolic Gestures

Similar to the above, frequently cheap way to achieve emotional benefits for the other.

## Communication

Sometimes, negotiators aren't actively engaged in discussion, but are merely having talks to impress third parties

Make it clear you're listening by repeating what the other party is saying back in your own words. _VF Note:_ I've found this effective when people are exaggerating or being unreasonable, hearing it said back to them makes them reconsider their position. This should be don in a positive and good-faith manner.

Book says: cheapest concession is saying to the other party that they're being heard. _VF Note:_ I think this is overused now and pretentious. A way of accepting criticism without engaging in a response for it.

A common loop without acknowledging the other's viewpoint is that the other things "I told them my view, but now they're saying somehting different, they must've not understood it." This can cause arguments to go in loops where everyone just says the same thing back at each other and no progress is made.

Finally, use non-violent communication: "I feel let down" instead of "You broke your word" to avoid emotional, defensive responses.

## Prevention 

Build an amicable relationship to help avoid emotional lock-ups. Arrive early to chat before the meeting.
