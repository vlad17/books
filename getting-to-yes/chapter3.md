# Focus on Interests, not Positions

## Interests define the problem

Positions are usually the obvious projections of multifaceted latent interests onto a single axis that people go to.

The true problem is defined by the interests. Recall the librarian example.

    Two men in the library are arguing over how far to open the window.
    One wants it open, another wants it closed.
    Halfway open, 1/4 open, it's tough to reach agreement.
    The librarian enters the room, asks the first man, why do you want it open?
    To get fresh air.
    To the next man, why do you want it closed?
    To avoid a draft.
    Then the librarian goes into another room, opening a wide window, which will let
    no draft in but allows fresh air.

Indeed, given the presence of a wide window in the other room, the latent position of the interests is a wider "constraint set" in which to solve the problem than the material decision variable that the two men initially focussed on.

_VF Note:_ Again, I'm wary that in many conflicts of interest, there are few "levers" involved, which makes the meat of the conversation the "objective metric" discussion, but again this might be later in the book.

Opposed Positions are driven by multifaceted latent interests, which may be conflicting or compatible.

## How to Identify Interests

Ask yourself why you hold certain positions. Ask yourself why your opposition may be holding alternative positions.

Understand that there are usually multiple interests stemming from multiple influencers which are pressuring the negotiator. E.g., the sports team manager must state that he believes a half-million dollar salary is unreasonable for a high performing player, even though players with similar talent on opposing teams get paid that amount. In fact, the manager might agree that that's a reasonable salary but is getting pressure from management because of money troubles that management doesn't want the players finding out about.

_VF Note:_ As a baseball player that figures out that this is what the manager is being pressured by, how do I navigate this? A good exercise.

Interests are driven by basic human needs, which map back to core drivers of emotions again: autonomy, appreciation, affiliation, role, status (but then also physical needs, such as security, safety, shelter, sustenance).

## Talking about Interests

Look forward, not back
* Pull the conversation away from grievances and onto future concerns.
* Why has dual meaning, one is for identifying causes, and the other is for assigning blame, only the former is useful, but only when done as an early discovery phase.

Be specific about how past events run counter to interests, but focus on the interests of it.

Ack their interests and appreciate them.

It is *not* wise to commit to a position, but it *is* wise to commit to interests.
